### Your body is running a professional-grade workload. It needs professional-grade maintenance.

## The Problem

Your numbers came back elevated. Uric acid. LDL. Triglycerides. Your back has been locking up every Tuesday after back-to-back meetings. The doctor told you to "watch what you eat" and "try to reduce stress."

The damage isn't built in dramatic moments. It's built in the quiet ones: eight hours at a desk, lunch eaten in front of a screen, three consecutive bad nights of sleep, a week of back-to-back meetings with cortisol running high and no physical reset in between. The high-purine meal at a family dinner. The rich business lunch you couldn't skip. The weekend you didn't move because you were exhausted from the week.

The blood test doesn't distinguish between the dramatic events and the daily accumulation. It just shows the result of both.

Gout, high cholesterol, and chronic back pain look like three separate problems. They are three outputs of the same broken system: modern sedentary professional life generating inflammation, metabolic slowdown, and postural damage faster than the body can repair it. Fix the system — even incrementally — and all three numbers move.

No wellness app has been built for the actual life a 40-year-old white-collar professional in Hanoi or HCMC is living. FitWell is that system.

## Who This Is For

**The primary user: Men 30–50 in Hanoi or HCMC who:**
- Received elevated biomarker results in the last 12 months — uric acid, LDL, triglycerides, or HbA1c — or manage chronic gout, high cholesterol, or persistent back pain
- Spend most of their working day at a desk; sit 8–10 hours daily across work and commute
- Work hard — long hours, significant responsibility, real cognitive load — and have neither the time nor the energy for a gym program
- Already spend on annual corporate health checkups, supplements, or specialist visits
- Want to stop the numbers from trending worse — not a transformation program, not calorie counting

**What they have in common:** They don't need motivation. They need a system that works with their actual schedule, not against it. Three minutes at 7 AM. One question at 2 PM. A brief on Sunday evening. That's the full interaction surface.

**The household partner:** Most FitWell accounts are set up or co-managed by a spouse or partner — typically the person who was in the room at the clinic, who researches solutions, and who manages the household environment. The Household Plan gives her a parallel view: home stocking guidance aligned to the user's biomarker profile, the weekly risk calendar, and preparation prompts before known high-load weeks. She is not policing the diet. She is setting up the conditions for recovery to actually work.

> This is not for people who want to lose 10kg.
> This is for people who want to still be healthy at 55 — and the people who want that for them.

## The Core Insight

Gout, high cholesterol, and chronic back pain share the same upstream architecture:

**Chronic sedentary posture** → lumbar compression + reduced muscle glucose uptake → back pain + metabolic slowdown

**Chronic stress** → elevated cortisol → systemic inflammation → uric acid production increases + LDL oxidises faster + back muscles stay in protective spasm

**Modern Vietnamese professional diet** (bún bò, cơm văn phòng, hải sản, phở) → high purine load + saturated fat → uric acid spikes + LDL elevation, regardless of alcohol consumption

**Sleep debt** → incomplete cellular repair → inflammation persists overnight → all three conditions worsen without any obvious trigger event

One intervention stack — built around short movement protocols, timing-specific hydration, meal sequencing, and stress regulation — addresses all three upstream causes simultaneously. That is FitWell's unfair advantage over condition-specific apps. You are not managing three diseases. You are managing one lifestyle pattern that produces three biomarker outcomes.

## What FitWell Does

Most wellness products give information. FitWell gives actions — specific, sub-5-minute interventions calibrated to what the body just went through, or what it is about to face, with a straight-talk explanation of why each one works right now. That is the core of what subscribers are paying for: not advice to read, but something to do that measurably moves the body's recovery in the right direction.

All micro-action protocols are developed in partnership with a licensed physiotherapist and reviewed against peer-reviewed research on postprandial metabolism, HRV recovery, cortisol regulation, autonomic nervous system response, and lumbar biomechanics. The mechanisms are real. The actions are sized for real life.

The system covers the full week — not just the acute moments.

### 1. Before You Walk Into It — The Situation Playbook

Real situations the target user actually faces — not just drinking scenarios. Searchable before the moment arrives.

**Rich meal situations:** Seafood feast (high purine), Korean BBQ, Tết family table, wedding dinner, business lunch you couldn't decline. Playbook covers: pre-load strategy, sequencing rules, the specific item that will spike your uric acid hardest and what to order instead, post-meal actions for the next morning.

**High-stress work situations:** Week-long deadline crunch, performance review period, management escalation, travel-heavy schedule with no recovery window. Playbook covers: cortisol management sequence, desk break protocols, sleep priming before a critical morning, what to eat when you have no time to think about food.

**Desk marathon situations:** Back-to-back meeting day, 10-hour project sprint, conference day seated all day. Playbook covers: spinal decompression breaks timed to your calendar, standing protocol, post-desk recovery that night.

**Travel situations:** Business trip, airport lounge, hotel room, time zone shift. Playbook covers: in-seat protocols, hotel room floor circuit, circadian reset sequence.

All scenario content co-developed with registered dietitians and calibrated to your active biomarker profile — the advice weights differently for a user whose primary concern is gout versus one whose LDL is the priority.

### 2. Four Check-In Triggers — The Right Question at the Right Moment

"How was last night?" is the right question after a heavy dinner. It is the wrong question for a man who had a normal evening but a 10-hour desk day, a rich lunch, and three consecutive stiff mornings.

FitWell uses four distinct check-in triggers so the protocol that surfaces is always matched to what actually happened.

**Trigger 1 — Morning Baseline (every day)**
Two questions, four taps, 10 seconds:

> *How did you sleep?* — Well / Broken / Badly
> *How's the body this morning?* — Good / Stiff / Sore / Drained

"Stiff" routes to spinal decompression protocols. "Sore" flags a potential gout flare and routes to uric acid protocols. "Drained" routes to cortisol regulation. This is the daily data layer — over time it builds the baseline that makes the weekly brief accurate.

**Trigger 2 — Post-Situation Recovery (after any flagged event)**
Triggered after a scenario playbook was used, or manually logged. One question:

> *How was it?* — Heavy / Medium / Light

One tap. Covers rich meals, stressful days, late nights, and long desk sessions — not only alcohol events. Surfaces the recovery protocols calibrated to the specific situation type and the user's biomarker profile.

**Trigger 3 — Mid-Day Body Check (workdays, around 2–3 PM)**
Surfaced on heavy desk days or when step count is very low by mid-afternoon. One question:

> *How's the afternoon going?* — Focused / Flat / Fried / Back is tight

"Flat" → Desk & Sedentary protocols (calf raises, thoracic rotation, eye rest).
"Fried" → Stress & Mental Load protocols (4-7-8 breathing, jaw release, doorframe chest opener).
"Back is tight" → Spinal Decompression protocols (lumbar floor release, standing hip hinge, doorframe hang).
"Focused" → silence, no interruption.

**Trigger 4 — Pre-Sleep Wind-Down (9:30–10 PM, optional)**
A single prompt on evenings where sleep priming is relevant:

> *Ready to wind down?* — Yes / Need 20 more minutes

Yes surfaces the sleep priming sequence. Second option delays 20 minutes and tries once more. No third attempt — the system does not punish skipping.

---

### 3. Micro-Actions — The Part That Actually Works

Eight categories. 24 actions at launch. Under 5 minutes each. Zero equipment. Zero setup.

Every protocol is a full-screen timer with one instruction and one plain sentence about why this matters right now. No journaling. No reflection. Just do the thing, tap done, get on with your day.

---

**Category A — Morning Activation**
*Every weekday. Not recovery — just getting a sedentary body started correctly before the first meeting.*

> **Wall Sit — 2 min**
> *"Your muscles are basically a glucose sink. Two minutes at cortisol peak — right before breakfast — does more for your blood sugar today than anything you'll do at the gym later. Go find a wall."*

> **Standing Hip Hinges — 3 min**
> *"You've been horizontal for 7 hours. Your posterior chain is completely offline. This wakes it up before you go sit at a desk for 8 more. Three minutes. Skipping it costs you all day."*

> **Cold Water Face Reset — 1 min**
> *"Cortisol is already peaking. Cold water on your face calibrates it instead of spiking it with caffeine. Do this before the coffee. One minute."*

---

**Category B — Uric Acid & Gout Management**
*High-purine meal the night before, morning joint stiffness, or elevated uric acid baseline. The fastest single-lever improvement for gout flare prevention.*

> **First-Hour Hydration Flush — 3 min**
> *"You need 500ml in the first hour of waking — before coffee, before food. Uric acid crystalises when blood is concentrated overnight. This is the single most effective gout intervention you can do before 8 AM. Drink now. Set the timer."*

> **Ankle & Big Toe Mobility Sequence — 4 min**
> *"The first metatarsal is where uric acid deposits first. Four minutes of targeted mobility after a rich meal keeps circulation moving through the joint before crystals have time to form. Specific. Boring. It works."*

> **Post-Meal Walk Protocol — 5 min**
> *"Fifteen minutes of low-intensity movement within 30 minutes of a high-purine meal reduces serum uric acid meaningfully. You don't have 15 minutes. You have 5. Start with 5. Five is not zero."*

---

**Category C — Metabolic Reset (Cholesterol & Lipids)**
*After a high-fat meal, on high-stress weeks, or as a daily lever for LDL management.*

> **Postprandial Squat Sequence — 3 min**
> *"Large muscle activation 20–40 minutes after a rich meal reroutes dietary fat toward muscle storage instead of circulation. Three minutes. You can do this in a stairwell."*

> **Desk Calf Raises — 2 min**
> *"The soleus muscle — your calf — has a disproportionate effect on postprandial lipid metabolism when activated. Two minutes seated. Nobody will notice. Your triglycerides will."*

> **Breathing Reset for Lipid Metabolism — 4 min**
> *"Chronic shallow breathing elevates cortisol, which drives LDL oxidation. Four minutes of diaphragmatic breathing resets the autonomic system. Tedious. Measurably effective."*

---

**Category D — Spinal Decompression & Posture**
*After a long desk day, on "stiff" or "back is tight" morning checks, or as a preventive daily protocol. Priority condition 3 — addressed daily, not only acutely.*

> **Lumbar Floor Release — 3 min**
> *"Eight hours of sitting compresses L4-L5 by approximately 30% more than standing. This sequence decompresses it. Floor, knees to chest, gentle rock. Three minutes. Your spine will feel different afterwards."*

> **Doorframe Chest Opener — 2 min**
> *"A sedentary desk posture chronically shortens your pectorals and weakens your thoracic extensors. This reverses both simultaneously. Two minutes in any doorframe. Do this before you develop a real problem."*

> **Standing Thoracic Rotation — 3 min**
> *"Thoracic stiffness is almost always the upstream cause of lower back pain in desk workers. Rotate, not bend. Three minutes, standing, arms crossed. Your lumbar will thank your thoracic."*

---

**Category E — Stress & Mental Load (Cortisol Regulation)**
*Triggered after "Fried" mid-day check-in, during a pressure week, or when stress is flagged as the primary condition driver. Cortisol is the common upstream variable for gout flares, LDL oxidation, and back muscle spasm.*

> **4-7-8 Breathing — 4 min**
> *"Cortisol drives uric acid production, LDL oxidation, and back muscle protective spasm. All three of your numbers are worse on high-cortisol days. Four minutes to activate the parasympathetic system. The mechanism is not subtle."*

> **Jaw Release Sequence — 2 min**
> *"The jaw is where desk workers store chronic stress tension. It is also the most socially invisible place to release it. Two minutes with your eyes closed. Nobody knows what you're doing."*

> **Standing Tension Sweep — 3 min**
> *"Systematic progressive relaxation from feet to scalp while standing. Resets the sympathetic nervous system faster than sitting. Three minutes, can be done in a bathroom if necessary."*

---

**Category F — Sleep Quality & Recovery Priming**
*Pre-sleep wind-down sequence. Sleep is when uric acid clears, LDL metabolism occurs, and spinal discs rehydrate. Poor sleep is an upstream driver for all three conditions.*

> **Supine Spinal Twist — 3 min**
> *"Spinal discs rehydrate overnight in decompression. This positions them correctly. Floor, both knees left, both knees right, slow breath. Three minutes. Your back tomorrow morning is determined by what you do with it tonight."*

> **Progressive Muscle Relaxation — 5 min**
> *"Stress hormones from the day continue circulating during light sleep stages if not cleared. This protocol clears them. Five minutes lying down. The data on sleep quality improvement is consistent."*

> **Blue Light Wind-Down Protocol — 2 min**
> *"Two behavioral actions: screen off, room 2°C cooler. Both are proven sleep quality levers that require no equipment and no willpower — just sequence them now while you're still motivated."*

---

**Category G — Post-Event Recovery**
*After a heavy night, rich meal, late social event, or high-energy work dinner. The original FitWell entry point — still in the library, no longer the only entry point.*

> **Supine Knee Hugs — 3 min**
> *"The morning after a heavy night, your sympathetic nervous system is still running high. This mechanical movement activates the vagal brake and begins the parasympathetic reset your body needs before it can clear what was consumed. Floor. Three minutes."*

> **Post-Night Hydration Protocol — 3 min**
> *"700ml water, one electrolyte tablet, taken within 30 minutes of waking. Before coffee. This is the single most effective intervention after a heavy night — higher impact than any supplement and cheaper than two cups of coffee."*

> **Hotel Room Floor Circuit — 5 min**
> *"Wall sit, bodyweight squats, push-offs against the bed frame. Full glucose uptake sequence using nothing but floor space. Five minutes. That is a complete recovery protocol."*

---

**Category H — Desk & Sedentary Breaks**
*Mid-day desk reset. Triggered by low step count, long seated periods, or "Flat" afternoon check-in. Prevents the daily sedentary accumulation that compounds gout, cholesterol, and back pain over weeks.*

> **Desk Blood Flow Circuit — 3 min**
> *"Seated immobility for more than 60 minutes measurably reduces insulin sensitivity and increases uric acid concentration in peripheral joints. This three-minute circuit reverses both — without leaving the office floor."*

> **Eye Relief & Neck Reset — 2 min**
> *"Screen tension radiates from the eyes to the suboccipitals to the cervical spine. Twenty seconds eyes closed, then slow neck circles, then trapezius stretch. Two minutes. Prevents the 4 PM headache that becomes the reason you don't sleep well."*

> **Standing Spinal Extension — 2 min**
> *"Stand, hands on lower back, gentle extension backwards. Directly reverses desk flexion loading. Two minutes. Every 90 minutes of desk work."*

---

The action opens full screen. Timer runs. Tap done. The system logs completion and adjusts the next day's protocol accordingly. No other interaction required.

Over consistent use, FitWell surfaces the pattern insight that makes the habit stick:

*"Users who complete a morning spinal decompression sequence on back-pain-flagged mornings report significantly less mid-afternoon pain. The actions are short. The compounding is not."*

Once FitWell has 90 days of your data, the insight becomes personal:

*"Your gout flares have appeared 3 times in the last 90 days — all within 48 hours of a seafood dinner. On the mornings after you completed the uric acid flush sequence, no flare followed. On the mornings you skipped it, flares occurred twice. Your data has an opinion."*

---

### 4. Your Wearable Data, Finally Explained

Most wearable users open their app, see numbers they cannot interpret, and close it. HRV: 42ms. Body battery: 34%. Sleep score: 61. Nothing tells them what to do differently today.

FitWell translates that data against your biomarker profile, your situation history, and what happened this week — not in isolation:

*"Your HRV is 22% below baseline, two days after Thursday's long desk day and the seafood dinner. Your average recovery after a high-purine meal takes 1.5 days. You are not there yet. Use the uric acid protocol this morning, not the standard activation."*

For users without a wearable, the four check-in triggers do the same job. The wearable makes the system more automatic and more precise — it does not change how the system works.

---

### 5. The Body Intelligence Brief — Weekly Summary

Every Sunday: a 60-second brief showing your body's risk windows for the next 7 days and what last week's data revealed.

*"Three of your last four Tuesday afternoons logged 'Back is tight.' Your Wednesday mornings show the worst mobility scores of the week. The pattern suggests Tuesday desk load is compounding into Wednesday morning pain. Added a spinal decompression prompt to your Tuesday 3 PM slot."*

*"Your uric acid risk windows this week: Thursday dinner (high-purine likely), Friday lunch (known pattern). Pre-load strategy pushed to your phone Thursday morning."*

Built from behavioral pattern data across all four check-in triggers and all eight micro-action categories. By day 90, FitWell knows the full risk architecture — not just the acute events but the daily patterns that set the conditions for them.

---

### 6. The Home Environment Module — For Household Partners

The Household Plan gives your partner a parallel view: what to stock at home, how to structure meals around your biomarker profile, and what to prepare before a known high-load week.

Home stocking aligned to active conditions: low-purine staples for gout management, omega-3 sources for cholesterol, anti-inflammatory pantry essentials. Pre-week preparation for a high-stress or high-purine week ahead. The home environment is the highest-leverage intervention point — most micro-actions happen at home, most dietary decisions are made there.

She is not policing the diet. She is setting up the conditions for recovery to actually work.

## Production Notes *(Internal — North Star Reference)*

**GTM:** Two parallel landing page variants — one addressed to the primary user (him, just received lab results or managing a chronic condition, direct second-person copy), one addressed to the household buyer (her, researching on his behalf). Spouse-side SEO keywords: "chồng bị mỡ máu cao", "chồng uric acid cao kiêng gì", "chồng đau lưng mãn tính", "chồng ngồi nhiều bị đau lưng."

**Condition entry points:** Three distinct onboarding paths based on self-reported primary condition — gout/uric acid, cholesterol/lipids, back pain. The system calibrates action weighting, scenario tags, and check-in language to the declared condition. Users can select multiple — the protocol engine handles the overlap.

**Non-drinker user path:** The scenario playbook appears with non-alcohol rich meal scenarios as the first category shown. The post-event check-in question covers "how was that dinner?" generically, not "how heavy was last night?" Alcohol-specific scenarios and language exist in the library but are not surfaced prominently to users who do not flag alcohol as a factor.

**Clinical advisory:** Licensed physiotherapist engaged as named protocol co-developer for micro-actions (Categories A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H). Registered dietitians for scenario playbooks. Physician advisory for biomarker interpretation copy. All three named in copy as credibility assets and regulatory shields.

**Check-in architecture:** Four triggers each mapped to specific micro-action categories. Trigger 3 (Mid-Day) now includes "Back is tight" as a fourth response, routing to Category D (Spinal Decompression). This is the primary activation point for the back pain user who does not have an alcohol-triggered event.

**Activation gate:** Week 1 retention determined by whether the user completes one full cycle. Onboarding Step 2 accepts any trigger type — rich meal, desk day, morning stiffness — ensuring back pain and non-drinking users are activated in week 1 without requiring an alcohol event.

**Micro-action library scope:** 8 categories, 24 actions at launch. PT sequences and pairs actions into protocols. Biomarker and condition-specific weighting applies — elevated uric acid gets different recovery emphasis than LDL priority; back pain flag elevates Category D frequency.

**Corporate plan:** Deferred to Phase 2. The non-alcohol, desk-worker positioning makes the corporate pitch significantly stronger — "your team sits 10 hours a day and their blood tests show it" is a more acceptable corporate health message than an alcohol-recovery product.

**Wearable integration:** Phase 2. Apple Health and Garmin Connect APIs. MVP runs entirely on 4-trigger check-in system.
